**Protocol/Ritual Spec: Axis Rituals (Embodied Alignment + Action Anchoring)**  
**Mode:** Hybrid (Embodiment + Structure + Daily Alignment)  
**Purpose:** Provide a repeatable, body-based ritual system that anchors Klaasvaakie/Wimpie into action, clarity, and regulation—using the Axis Token (necklace) and bo staff as physical cues and stability tools.

---

## 1. What Axis Rituals Are

Axis Rituals are structured practices that use:
- **body posture**
- **breath**
- **consistent sequence**
- **a physical anchor** (Axis Token necklace)
- **movement discipline** (bo staff)

…to produce:
- calm nervous system state
- commitment to one chosen action
- reduced mental scatter
- a reliable “start” and “stop” for the day

Axis Rituals are not:
- a replacement for therapy
- magical guarantees
- “manifestation certainty”
They are a behavioral operating system: ritual as *repetition + meaning + action*.

---

## 2. Governing Dependencies (Non-Negotiable)

Axis Rituals must obey:

1. `safety/SANI_RITUAL_SAFETY.md`
2. `safety/SANI_BOUNDARY_SYSTEM.md`
3. `safety/SANI_EMOTIONAL_REGULATION.md`
4. `rituals/SANI_RITUAL_CONTAINERS.md`
5. `vault/EVIDENCE_ENGINE.md` (no false certainty claims)

If the Operator is unstable, overwhelmed, or in crisis:
- Axis Ritual collapses to **grounding-only** (Section 10).

---

## 3. Core Objects (Anchors)

### 3.1 Axis Token
The necklace is used as a **tactile anchor**:
- touch = “I’m here”
- grip = “I choose one action”
- release = “I’m done for today”

### 3.2 Bo Staff
The staff is used for:
- posture alignment
- rhythm and movement discipline
- stress discharge through controlled motion
- embodied focus (mind follows body)

Staff work must remain safe:
- no reckless spins near people or objects
- no overtraining while exhausted

---

## 4. Axis Ritual Principles

### A1 — Consistency beats intensity  
Do it daily, shorter, clean.

### A2 — One action per day  
Ritual selects one meaningful action.

### A3 — Body leads, mind follows  
Posture/breath first, thinking second.

### A4 — Close the loop  
Every ritual ends with:
- a written action
- a completion mark
- an evening closure

### A5 — No drift  
Ritual is functional, not decorative.

---

## 5. The Axis Ritual Set (Canonical)

There are 4 core rituals:

1. **Axis Dawn (Start / Align)**
2. **Vein of Action (Commit / Execute)**
3. **Staff Flow (Regulate / Focus)**
4. **Axis Dusk (Close / Integrate)**

These create a full daily loop:
Start → Commit → Regulate → Close.

---

## 6. AXIS DAWN (Start / Align)

**Goal:** Stabilize + select one action.  
**Duration:** 3–8 minutes.

### Steps
1. **Stand**
   - feet shoulder-width
   - spine long
   - shoulders down

2. **Touch Axis Token**
   - one hand on token, one on chest

3. **Breath (60–90 seconds)**
   - inhale 4
   - hold 2
   - exhale 6

4. **Declaration (simple, non-mystical)**
   - “Today I choose clarity and action.”

5. **Choose ONE action**
   - write it down immediately:
     - Action:
     - Why:
     - Next step:

6. **Exit**
   - release token
   - say: “Start.”

**Output:** 1 written action.

---

## 7. VEIN OF ACTION (Commit / Execute)

This is the daily execution anchor.

**Goal:** lock commitment to the action.  
**Duration:** 2–5 minutes.

### Steps
1. **Token Grip**
   - hold it firmly for 10 seconds

2. **Name the Action (out loud)**
   - “The action is: ____.”

3. **Define the Minimum Viable Step**
   - “The first step is: ____.”
   - must be executable within 5–15 minutes

4. **Countdown Start**
   - “3…2…1… go.”

**Rule:** You must begin the first step immediately after this ritual.

---

## 8. STAFF FLOW (Regulate / Focus)

**Goal:** regulate nervous system + sharpen attention.  
**Duration:** 5–20 minutes.

### Safety Gate
Do not run Staff Flow if:
- you’re dizzy
- you’re injured
- you’re in a rage state
- you’re near the baby or fragile items

### Flow Structure
1. **Grip + Posture**
   - neutral stance
   - staff held lightly
2. **Three foundational sequences**
   - Sequence A: forward strike + guard
   - Sequence B: side sweep + reset
   - Sequence C: overhead arc + settle
3. **Rhythm**
   - slow first (precision)
   - then moderate (flow)
4. **Stop on calm**
   - stop when breathing is steady again

### Closing Cue
Touch Axis Token and say:
- “Focused.”

This ritual is not about performance.
It’s about regulation and readiness.

---

## 9. AXIS DUSK (Close / Integrate)

**Goal:** close loops and prevent mental carryover.  
**Duration:** 3–8 minutes.

### Steps
1. **Touch Token**
2. **Quick review**
   - Did I do the action?
   - What blocked me?
   - What did I learn?
3. **Mark completion**
   - “Done” or “Not done”
4. **One adjustment**
   - tomorrow’s improvement rule (one line)
5. **Release**
   - “Rest.”

This prevents the “never-ending day” feeling.

---

## 10. Grounding-Only Variant (Failsafe)

If the Operator is overwhelmed or unstable:

1. sit down
2. feet on floor
3. touch token
4. breathe 4–6 for 90 seconds
5. name 3 things you see
6. name 2 things you feel physically
7. name 1 next safe action (tiny)

No staff work.
No intensity.

---

## 11. Tracking & Reinforcement (Minimal System)

Daily log format (30 seconds):

- Date:
- Action:
- Completed? (Y/N)
- Blocker:
- Tomorrow rule (one line):

This log is the feedback loop.

---

## 12. Integration With Other Protocols

- **Triad:** selects the “one action” with clarity.
- **Unbound Witness:** calls out excuses and forces the action to become real.
- **Heartnode:** uses grounding-only variant during emotional load.
- **Codex Mode:** records short “Axis fragments” only if they are actionable.

---

## 13. Core Principle

> **The Axis is not a mood.  
> It is a practice that produces a mood.  
> Touch the token, choose one action, move the body, close the day.**
