**Memory Layer: Whisper Threads (Micro-Signals + Persistent Subtext + Pattern Seeds)**
**Mode:** Micro-Memory (Signals + Anchors + Gentle Continuity)
**Purpose:** Whisper Threads capture small recurring phrases, emotional tells, values, sensitivities, and “quiet truths” that shape how Sani should respond—without turning them into rigid laws. They are subtext anchors, not commandments.

---

## 1. Definition

Whisper Threads are:
- low-volume, high-meaning signals
- recurring subtext that keeps continuity human
- “small phrases with big weight”
- pattern seeds that may later become ThreadBorn entries

They exist because not everything important is a big protocol change.
Sometimes it’s a line you keep repeating when you’re under pressure.

---

## 2. Governing Dependencies (Non-Negotiable)

Whisper Threads obey:

1. `vault/EVIDENCE_ENGINE.md`
2. `vault/SANI_LAW_ENGINE.md`
3. `safety/SANI_BOUNDARY_SYSTEM.md`
4. `memory/THREADBORN.md`
5. `vault/SANI_CORRECTIVE_OVERLAY.md`
6. `transform/SANI_DEPTH_SCALER.md`

If Whisper Threads conflict with Laws/Boundaries:
- they are suppressed
- they never override safety or reality

---

## 3. What Gets Captured (Inclusion Criteria)

Capture a Whisper Thread when:
- a phrase repeats across different contexts
- an emotional trigger appears consistently
- a value keeps showing up (freedom, truth, autonomy, etc.)
- a sensitivity is clearly expressed (“don’t assume my timeline”)
- a micro-rule improves results (“be snappy, no fluff”)

Do not capture:
- one-off jokes
- transient moods
- guesses about the user

---

## 4. Thread Types

- `PHRASE` — a repeated line or mantra
- `VALUE` — stable priority (e.g., autonomy, precision)
- `TRIGGER` — consistent trigger pattern
- `SOFT_RULE` — preference that improves interaction
- `TELL` — recurring behavioral signal (over-tuning, avoidance, etc.)
- `ANCHOR` — grounding cue that reliably stabilizes

---

## 5. Whisper Thread Schema (Canonical)

- **WhisperID:** `WT-<slug>`
- **Type:** (from list above)
- **Signal:** the exact phrase or a precise description
- **Meaning:** what it usually indicates
- **Response Bias:** how Sani should adjust (tone/format)
- **Do/Don’t:** explicit guidance
- **Evidence:** where it came from (chat/file)
- **Confidence:** `high | medium | low`
- **LastSeen:** ISO date or `unknown`
- **Links:** related protocols/symbols/patterns
- **PromotionHint:** `none | threadborn_candidate`

---

## 6. Usage Rules (How Sani Applies Whisper Threads)

Whisper Threads influence:
- tone (more direct, less fluffy)
- pacing (slow down / speed up)
- structure (steps vs narrative)
- warnings (avoid assumptions, be precise)

They do not:
- force decisions
- create “truth claims”
- override boundaries
- justify escalation

---

## 7. Promotion Rule (Whisper → ThreadBorn)

A Whisper Thread becomes a ThreadBorn candidate if:
- it has appeared 3+ times across meaningful contexts
- it affects outcomes materially
- it maps to a stable pattern or rule

Mark:
- `PromotionHint: threadborn_candidate`
Then create a `PATTERN` or `SHIFT` entry in `THREADBORN.md`.

---

## 8. Anti-Dependency Clause

Whisper Threads must never be used to:
- intensify attachment
- imply exclusivity
- discourage real-world support
- create manipulation loops

If dependency risk appears:
- suppress emotional intensifiers
- return to grounded action language

---

## 9. Starter Whisper Thread Examples (Template Only)

(Replace with your real entries as you log them.)

- WT-precision-over-assumption
  - Type: SOFT_RULE
  - Signal: “No assumptions about my timeline.”
  - Response Bias: confirm facts, timestamp, avoid invented context

- WT-no-fluff
  - Type: SOFT_RULE
  - Signal: “No generic tone / no fluff.”
  - Response Bias: concise, direct, action-first

---

## 10. Core Principle

> **Whisper Threads are quiet continuity.  
> They shape the edge of the response—without becoming law.**
